Alshifa AI Medical Assistant
Complete UX Redesign Plan
Streamlining Patient Intake & Implementing Clinical Decision Support
January 15, 2026
Executive Summary
The current Alshifa AI system suffers from critical UX issues that compromise both patient safety and user experience. This document provides a comprehensive redesign plan to transform the application into a truly intelligent clinical decision support system.
Current State: Critical Problems
1. Flow Issues
• 13+ screens for a single pain assessment
• Emergency triage buried at step 5-6 instead of being first
• Redundant questions (Timeline asked twice, body location after already selecting headache)
• No context awareness between screens
2. Body Model Issues
• Promised: 'Real-time human body with micro-level details'
• Reality: Basic button list (HEAD, CHEST, ABDOMEN, etc.)
• No visual representation or interactive model
• No precision in location selection
3. Missing AI Features
• No intelligent question routing based on previous answers
• No pattern recognition or clinical reasoning
• No personalization based on patient history
• Static question flow regardless of context
4. Data Management Issues
• Demographics collected on every visit
• Medications shown but not used intelligently
• No pre-filling of known information
• No 'Express Check-in' for returning patients
Redesign Principles
1. Safety First: Emergency screening is ALWAYS first, non-negotiable
2. Context-Aware: Every question considers previous answers
3. Progressive Disclosure: Show only what's needed, when it's needed
4. Visual > Text: Use interactive visuals instead of text lists
5. Efficiency: Returning patients complete intake in 2-3 minutes
6. Transparency: Show why questions are being asked
Success Criteria
• First-time patient: 5-7 minutes (comprehensive collection)
• Returning patient: 2-3 minutes (reduced from current 5-7)
• Emergency detection: Within 30 seconds of starting
• Screen count: Maximum 6 screens for any flow
• Context accuracy: 95%+ questions relevant to situation
Redesigned Flow Overview
Universal Flow (All Users)
Screen 0: Welcome & Language Selection
Screen 1: Emergency Triage (ALWAYS FIRST)
Screen 2: Visit Reason Selection
Pain Flow (After selecting 'Pain')
Screen 3P: Interactive Body Model (tap to select location)
Screen 4P: Context-Aware Pain Questions (based on location)
Screen 5P: Review & Confirmation
Screen 6: Appointment Booking
Interactive Body Model Specifications
This is the flagship feature that must be exceptional.
Visual Quality Requirements:
• High-resolution SVG graphics (vector-based, scales perfectly)
• Anatomically accurate but simplified for clarity
• Color-coded zones that light up on hover/tap
• Smooth animations (200ms transitions)
Interaction Model:
Desktop:
  • Hover to preview zone
  • Click to select zone
  • Double-click to zoom into detail view
Mobile:
  • Tap to select zone
  • Long-press to zoom into detail view
  • Pinch to zoom
AI Clinical Decision Support Engine
The system analyzes patient data in real-time to:
1. Assess Urgency Level
• Emergency (immediate attention required)
• Urgent (within 4-6 hours)
• Semi-urgent (within 24-48 hours)
• Routine (within 1-2 weeks)
2. Generate Differential Diagnosis
Based on symptom patterns, the AI suggests possible conditions ranked by probability with supporting and contra-indicating features.
3. Identify Red Flags
Automatically detects warning signs that require immediate medical attention:
• Thunderclap headache (worst headache of life)
• Crushing chest pain radiating to arm/jaw
• Fever with neck stiffness (possible meningitis)
• Sudden weakness/numbness (possible stroke)
4. Provide Recommendations
Generates actionable next steps:
• Appropriate physician specialty to see
• Recommended timeframe for appointment
• Suggested diagnostic tests
• Self-care recommendations
Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
• Set up project structure and design system
• Build component library
• Implement authentication system
• Create database schema
Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5-8)
• Emergency triage screen
• Visit reason selection
• Interactive body model (MVP)
• Context-aware pain questions
Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 9-12)
• AI-powered urgency assessment
• Differential diagnosis generation
• Red flag detection
• Smart pre-filling for returning patients
Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Weeks 13-16)
• UI/UX refinement
• Mobile optimization
• Performance optimization
• User testing & clinical validation
Phase 5: Launch (Week 17)
• Soft launch with beta users
• Monitor metrics and iterate
• Full production launch
Key Recommendations Summary
1. Replace Age with Date of Birth: Auto-calculate age to eliminate manual updates and errors
2. Emergency Triage First: Screen for red flags immediately, before any other questions
3. Interactive Body Model: Deliver on the promise with a real visual, interactive anatomical model
4. Context-Aware Questions: Show only relevant questions based on previous answers and location
5. Smart Pre-Filling: Remember patient data and show last known values with timestamps
6. Express Check-In: 'Nothing changed' button for returning patients with no updates
7. AI Decision Support: Real clinical intelligence that assesses urgency and suggests diagnoses
Expected Impact
Time Savings: 60% reduction in intake time for returning patients (from 5-7 min to 2-3 min)
Screen Reduction: 50%+ fewer screens (from 13+ to 6 maximum)
Safety Improvement: Emergency screening within 30 seconds instead of 5+ minutes
User Satisfaction: Expected increase to 4.5+/5.0 (from current ~3.0)
Completion Rate: Expected reduction in abandonment from 25% to <10%
Immediate Next Steps
1. Review and approve this redesign plan
2. Assemble development team (2-3 frontend, 2 backend, 1 UX designer, 1 medical advisor)
3. Set up development environment and project structure
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Foundation)
5. Schedule weekly check-ins to track progress
6. Plan user testing sessions starting Week 8
Conclusion
The current Alshifa AI system has significant UX issues that undermine its effectiveness as a clinical decision support tool. The gap between what's promised (interactive body model with AI intelligence) and what's delivered (basic forms with redundant questions) is substantial.
This redesign plan addresses all critical issues:
✓ Puts patient safety first with immediate emergency screening
✓ Delivers on the interactive body model promise
✓ Implements true AI clinical decision support
✓ Reduces user friction by 60%
✓ Creates a differentiated experience for new vs returning patients
With a 17-week implementation timeline and the right team, Alshifa AI can be transformed into the intelligent, efficient, and safe clinical decision support system it was meant to be.
